@mwadmin@mastodon.world You mean like you are and have been
spamming https://matrix.rocks/ for the
past tree month, or rather since day one, the instance came alive, first with
a Pleroma instance, since then with the current Miss key server.

Who do you think you are, the #internetPolice? since you are threatening our
users on opur platform in this way? Or are you just simply bullies that
tries to undermine smaller instances, like Mark Zuckerberg's attempt on take
down the Fediverse for good? (https://www.reck.

If any of your users have been spamming https://matrix.rocks/, then
reporting him/her/it is the right thing to do, I don't know what those
reports you referer to should be about, and I just care as little about it as
you are before you are spamming others, without even taking a look at what
they report... And they never even have any noted, telling what the
report is about, while all our forwarded reports have notes about what is
reported, otherwise we will not forward them, unlike you at
@mwadmin@mastodon.world blindly are doing.

However, I'm open for a new tone of voice, where you keep your spammers to your
self, and ensure keeping improper user incident reports to your self, and only
sends actual reports with actual information to third parties.

I'll see what I can do.

All this said, I do believe there are lacking a more common guideline for what
and `if == true`, then when should a report be forwarded?

Please notice this is a public response, as we be leave in openness, giving
users full inside in the admins work.
